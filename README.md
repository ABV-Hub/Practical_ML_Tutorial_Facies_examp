# Practical_ML_Tutorial_Facies_examp
Although there are tons of great books and papers outside to practice machine learning, I always wanted to see something short, simple, and with a descriptive manuscript. I always wanted to see an example with an appropriate explanation of the procedure accompanied by detailed results interpretation. Model evaluation metrics should also need to be elaborated clearly.
In this work, I will try to include all important steps of ML modeling (even though some are not necessary for this dataset) to make a consistent and tangible example, especially for geoscientists. Eight important ML algorithms will be examined and results will be compared. I will try to have an argumentative model evaluation discussion. I will not go deep into the algorithm's fundamentals.
This tutorial has three parts: Part1: Data Exploratory Analysis, Part2: Build Model & Validate, and Part3: Model Evaluation.
